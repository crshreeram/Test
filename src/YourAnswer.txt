Write below your answer for the third task: 

Q: Explain what is a good software and a good code. 

A: 
A Good Software will have the below characteristics
1. Functional or Correctness (Should do what it is intended to do)
2. Maintainable (Should be easy to maintain)
3. Reusability (Less code duplication and part/functionality of the code should be reusable)
4. Reliability (The software should be realiable enough to perform the way it was intended to work without any hinderances)
5. Portable (The architecture should make it easy for porting based on different use cases)
6. Efficiency (The software should be efficient and perform well under stress and load)
7. Secure


In my opinion good code would have the below attributes
1. Simple to read and understand.
2. Follows good naming and coding standards.
3. Testable
4. maintainable
5. Less errorprone
6. Reusable
7. Efficient
8. Modular ( helps in reusability - point 6)
